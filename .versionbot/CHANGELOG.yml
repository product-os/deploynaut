      hash: c96b03aeb612e01387e737ab430b066fe38e3769
      body: |
        This was working for deployment protection events because
        only the tip of the branch was considered for approval.

        But the logs showed that when evaluating all of the commits
        on a PR, the verification properties were undefined.

        This is due to the different schema returned by the listCommits
        endpoint vs the getCommit endpoint we had not accounted for.

      hash: 4f1d36743a2e169c697b1fba73bddfc3a1c43402
      body: |
        "only_has_authors_in" is satisfied when all relevant commits are
        authored by users in the users list or that belong to any of the
        listed organizations or teams.

        This differs from "only_has_contributors_in" in that it does not
        take into account the committers, and allows filtering on authors
        only.

    - subject: Implement policy-driven deployment approvals with YAML configuration
      hash: ca26dee2a98784c03992be6ba17044a0d4879ff1
      body: >
        Introduces a comprehensive policy evaluation system that replaces the
        previous

        hardcoded approval logic with flexible, configurable rules defined in
        YAML.


        Key changes:

        - Add PolicyEvaluator with support for AND/OR rule combinations

        - Implement signature validation using GitHub's verification status

        - Support multiple approval methods (reviews, comments)

        - Support multiple rule conditions (authors, environments, signatures)

        - Comprehensive test suite with policy configuration fixtures


        The new system enables secure, customizable deployment approval
        workflows

        while maintaining TOCTOU attack prevention and actor separation
        requirements.

        Newer versions of the octokit SDK have updated this

        We were only using it to avoid creating duplicate comments so
        we can just skip that step.

      body: |
        The previous pending workflow query was based on the reviewed
        commit SHA but this would not return any pull_request_target events.

        This change updates the filter to find all pending workflows based
        on the branch, then reduces the list further by approved commits
        or event type.

        The events must already be in a pending state before the approval
        is received, this is unchanged.

      body: |
        These events include the same information as pull request events
        if they are triggered in the context of a PR.

        If they are triggered as a standalone workflow run, there will be no
        associated PRs to find matching reviews and they will remain unapproved.

      hash: 29ef261f1810a4704ba5ab21bb9aaa3b29aeae7c
      body: |
        Testing confirmed that the deployment creator property
        will reflect whoever triggered the workflow, including performing
        actions like merging a PR, and does not reflect the commit author.

        Instead, compare review authors and bypass users against the author
        of the commit that triggered the event.

      hash: 2b1fa79d40e80c5fd51923e3dfa1e990da1ded4b
      body: |
        Getting a list of commit authors is an async operation that
        leaves a small window for a time-of-use attack.

        Prefer to use data from the initial event context where possible
        and avoid extra async calls to the GitHub API.
