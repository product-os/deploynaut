      hash: 5b3b8d9c04d15389e0d7e36328c45a837958aa25
      body: |
        Newer versions of the octokit SDK have updated this
        property and it can now possibly return null.

        We were only using it to avoid creating duplicate comments so
        we can just skip that step.

      hash: 5b3cb730e6593d4d8752eb9a329f0897e288a56c
      body: |
        The previous pending workflow query was based on the reviewed
        commit SHA but this would not return any pull_request_target events.

        This change updates the filter to find all pending workflows based
        on the branch, then reduces the list further by approved commits
        or event type.

        The events must already be in a pending state before the approval
        is received, this is unchanged.

        If they are triggered as a standalone workflow run, there will be no
        associated PRs to find matching reviews and they will remain unapproved.

        Testing confirmed that the deployment creator property
        will reflect whoever triggered the workflow, including performing
        actions like merging a PR, and does not reflect the commit author.

        Instead, compare review authors and bypass users against the author
        of the commit that triggered the event.

        and avoid extra async calls to the GitHub API.
